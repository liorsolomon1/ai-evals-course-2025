# AI Evals Course - July 2025

This repository contains materials for an AI evaluations course focused on building and evaluating a customer support chatbot using Braintrust. You'll learn how to generate synthetic data, create evaluation tasks, and measure the performance of AI systems.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign up for Braintrust

First, create your Braintrust account using this link: [Sign up for Braintrust](https://braintrust.dev/signup?utm_source=online_course&utm_medium=course_promo&utm_campaign=evals_course_signup).

If this is your first time using Braintrust, you'll need to create a default organization (e.g., can be anything but typical values are the name of your business or team).

### 2. Set up API Keys

You'll need to obtain and configure the following API keys:

- **BRAINTRUST_API_KEY**: Go to Settings > API Keys to create.
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Get this from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Get this from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

```bash
BRAINTRUST_API_KEY=your_braintrust_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> **Using a single provider:** If you only have one LLM provider (e.g. Anthropic but not OpenAI), you can set `MODEL_NAME` and `MODEL_NAME_REWRITE` to models from the same provider. The query rewrite agent defaults to `gpt-4.1-nano` (OpenAI) but can be overridden:
>
> ```bash
> MODEL_NAME=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
> MODEL_NAME_REWRITE=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
> ```
>
> See [LiteLLM docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for supported provider prefixes.

### 3. Configure AI Providers in Braintrust

If you want to use Anthropic and OpenAI models with Braintrust Loop:

1. Go to your Braintrust dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > AI Providers**
3. Add your Anthropic and OpenAI API keys there

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python package management. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### 1. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment with Python 3.12+
uv venv --python 3.12

# Activate the virtual environment

# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Install all project dependencies
uv sync

# Install with development dependencies (recommended)
uv sync --group dev
```

## Running Recipe Bot

```python
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
